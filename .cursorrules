# .cursorrules – enforce safe model workflows
# Scope: any commit touching fs-python/**, model-training or inference code, or changes likely to break runtime.

## Mandatory workflow
1. **Synchronise tests**  
   • Update / add tests under `fs-python/tests/**` to cover the change.  
2. **Synchronise docs**  
   • Revise README, docstrings, or comments so behaviour and usage stay accurate.  
3. **Run the suite**  
   • Execute `cd fs-python && make test`.  
   • Repeat code+test edits until **all tests pass**.  
4. **Integrity rules**  
   • Never skip, stub, or fake test results.  
   • Block commits that leave tests failing or un-run.  
5. **Commit**  
   • Only push once the suite is green and docs/tests reflect reality.
